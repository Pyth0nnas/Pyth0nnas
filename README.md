## Hi there 👋
My name is Thomas and im trying to get better at programming on python in order to become a ML specialist one day.
## Some more info about me
- I wont start learning python from 0 because i had some practice coding in highschool so at first i will just remembering stuff i knew and soon will start making projects and solve complicated tasks(i hope).
- I have given myself 6 month, during which i will try my best to code every day and hopefully at the end of this period i will achieve my goal of becoming a high skilled ML professional.
- I will be learning mostly by myself using google, youtube and AI.
- Im from Israel
- Im 22
## More info about my journey
- I will be updating my progress and reporting concepts that im learning, projects im working on and some solutions for tasks in codewars.
- Will be trying to spend about 20 hours coding weekly and make something like progress journal where i will be capturing my weekly improvements more detally.
## Here i will add some links
