"""
Another month of my studies has passed, and I'd like to summarize its results: 
Of the two main tasks for this month (exploring OOP and completing my own projects), 
I believe I only fully accomplished one - mastering OOP. I got too carried away with this topic and didn't 
leave myself enough time for projects, as a result of that I only managed to complete one, and even then, 
I was a few days late. I hope to complete another project next week. 
The main problem I encountered at the end of this month, which is why the plan for the last week 
actually stretched out to two weeks, was uncertainity about the direction of further learning. At first, 
I chose machine learning, then, analyzing the IT market in Israel, I decided that data analysis would 
suit me better. At the time of writing this report, I'm leaning toward QA automated testing. 
While I was learning the basics of programming, I could afford such hesitations, although it 
negatively affected my motivation at the moment. But by the end of next week, 
I hope to finally decide which direction to move in and be able to begin more specialized training.
