##Current week progress:
- i have trained using more different data types(dict, set, tuple), and improved my understanding of algorithms.
- have solved 15 more katas in codewars, started working with more complex katas(6kyu).
- observed and studied others solutions to differend problems, improving my code reading skills.

##Next week goals:
- solve some more codewars katas, try to get confident in solving 6kyu challenges.
- learn some more coding concepts and methods in python.
- learn the principle of efficiency and try to calculate efficiency in different codes.
