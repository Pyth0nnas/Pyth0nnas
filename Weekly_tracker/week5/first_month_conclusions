"""
I feel the need to summarize my steps toward my goal over the first month. At first,
solving the CodeWars problems went quickly, and I easily recalled functions and concepts
I'd already learned in the past. I even thought I'd reach my goal before the deadline. 
However, after successfully solving the 6kyu problems, I realized I hadn't covered very extensive topics such as OOP, 
working with files and imports, and working on code efficiency. 
I then realized that without this knowledge, I would have no way to move forward with creating my own projects and reaching level 5kyu. 
Now that I know what I need to work on, I'll devote the entire month to studying the missed topics and preparing for 5kyu. 
I hope that by the beginning of February, I'll have several practical projects under my belt, 
confident that I haven't missed anything important, and ready to advance to the next level of coding.
