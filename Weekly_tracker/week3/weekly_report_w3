## Current week progress:
-i have improved my coding skills resolving more 6kyu katas on codewars.
-i have improved my understanding of recursion.
-in order to challenge my knowledge i asked AI to generate a 6kyu level exam for me consisting of 5 tasks,
4 of which i have correctly or practically correctly resolved(it turned out 5th one was more complicated than 6kyu).

## Next week goals:
-get acquainted with OOP with whom i hadnt contact yet.
-finally get understanding of code efficiency and how to calculate it(i didnt managed to do this on current week).
